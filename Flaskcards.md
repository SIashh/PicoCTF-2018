Challenge name : Flaskcards

Challenge description : We found this fishy website for flashcards that we think may be sending secrets. Could you take a look?

Challenge hints : - Are there any common vulnerabilities with the backend of the website?
                  - Is there anywhere that filtering doesn't get applied?
                  - The database gets reverted every 2 hours so your session might end unexpectedly. Just make another user

# Introduction

This challenge was about SSTI (Server Side Template Injection), as mentionned in the title. Indeed, why *flaskcards* instead of *flashcards* ? We just made a few researches about Flask on the net and it turned out that Flask was a Python Microframework used to develop web content.
